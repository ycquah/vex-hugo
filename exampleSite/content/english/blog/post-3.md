I am advising you not to use Manual (hand driven) hammock or manual rocking crib to rock the baby to sleep.  Base on my many years of experience in this hammock, hereby I listed why you shall not use manual rocking bed or hammock.  

### Is Wrong to Rock in Left and Right Direction

Many baby cribs or hanging hammock on the market are using manual rocking by hand.  Especially the crib with left and right direction swing.  The cribs are build because it was  easy to manufacture to move in left and right direction. It was designed without the deeper thought of how the baby feel when rock with a left and right direction.  Try it yourself by looking at left and right in every second,  you will be rock to pass out or fainted or even vomit what your have eated.  The left and right rocking cause the head of the baby to be turning and turning the head could cause the bone in the neck blocking the blood from flowing to the head. That is why turning our head can cause pass out.  

But if you are moving with forward and backward direction, it will not cause pass out.  

 

### Inconsistent Rocking Speed

If you are using the up down movement of the hammock with springs. Usually, the parents let the nanny or caretaker or even close relative like grand parents to manually rock the cradle for a short while for baby to sleep.  Human will not be able to rock the cradle consistently or with the same speed. Inconsistent speed can possibly cause the baby to sleep and then frighten awake numerous times.  Have you ever experience woken up  just as you were about to fall asleep ?  You wake up with the jerk, or the feeling of falling ?  This is called hypnic jerks, hypnagogic jerks, or sleep starts. 

### Risk of Using Strangling Rope or Strap

This is a very usual scene. The grandparent or nanny will tied a rope to the manual rocking hammock and he/she will lying on the sofa and use the rope to manually drive the cradle.  This look perfectly normal but you might not be aware that strangling rope will somehow fall into the baby head or neck and cause strangulation.  There are even case of baby sitting crib where a strangling safety belt rope for the crib fall behind of the baby sit. This is safe to the baby but the sibling baby who is crawling outside the baby crib was somehow strangulated and cause deadly strangulation without the care taker awareness.

This happen and is real story.
