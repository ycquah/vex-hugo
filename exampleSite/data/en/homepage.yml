    content: "“The spring cradle is absolutely recommended! Our daughter had trouble
      finding sleep due to colic and screaming. Now she finds sleep and as a result,
      her drinking behavior became better and more regular, the colic and screaming
      are less. ”"

    content: "“Our son was struggling with colic. He cried a lot and unfortunately
      he could not sleep properly. We have tried everything possible so that the little
      man can sleep. Running back and forth in the apartment, etc. After we brought
      the cralde, our little man fell asleep immediately in the cradle. Really right
      now. Suddenly you have time for you, household and you can eat in peace. We
      are really excited and do not want to miss the cradle anymore.”\n"

    content: A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and
      feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
      souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
      sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
